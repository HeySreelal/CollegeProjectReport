Welcome to the Edakkal Caves Ticket Booking System Documentation Repository! This comprehensive project, developed in collaboration with the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) and BitSmart - the Incubation & Innovation Cell at Mary Matha Arts & Science College, Mananthavady, aims to streamline and enhance the visitor experience to the historical Edakkal Caves in Wayanad, Kerala.

## About Edakkal Caves

Situated 1,200 meters above sea level on Ambukutty Mala, Edakkal Caves boast natural wonders and historical significance. The caves, located 25 km from Kalpetta, reveal pictorial writings dating back to at least 6,000 BCE. These Neolithic-era carvings provide a glimpse into the region's prehistoric settlement, making Edakkal Caves a unique archaeological site.

## Project Overview
